## Notifications Center

The Notifications Center is designed to keep you updated of any workspace and
dashboard changes. Open it by selecting the **bell icon** in the top right section of the application.

Whenever you receive a notification, you will see a change in the
notifications' icon. Depending on your notification settings, you might
also see an in-app notification with the specific change.

In the Notification Center you can:

  - Mark all notifications as **Read** or **Unread** by selecting the
    *glasses icon*.

  - **Group** your notifications by **Date** or **Workspace**.

  - Additionally, you can **turn off notifications** by selecting the
    *Mute this type of notification* option in the overflow menu.

### Notification Types

You can receive three different types of notifications for both **Workspace**
and **Dashboard** changes:

  - **Email** notifications, which will be delivered to the e-mail
    address associated with your account.

  - **Push** notifications, which will be displayed as texts under the
    notification icon.

  - **In-App** notifications, displayed with a number inside the
    notifications icon.

To **edit** your notifications preferences, select the *pencil icon*. To
**turn on/off** notifications, click/tap the *toggle button* on the
right.

#### Workspace Notifications

You can configure your Reveal account to receive notifications when you
are removed from a workspace, or whenever new members join a workspace you are
already part of.

For Workspaces, the following settings are enabled by default:

|                         | Email                                                     | Push | In-App                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |

| New members join        |                                                           |      | <img src="images/enabled-feature.png" alt="enabled feature" />           |

#### Dashboard Notifications

You can configure your account to receive notifications whenever dashboards are shared with you or with a workspace, or when they are updated.

For Dashboards, the following settings are enabled by default:

|                                     | Email                                                     | Push                                                      | In-App                                                    |
