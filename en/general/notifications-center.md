dashboard changes. Open it by selecting the **bell icon** in the top

Whenever you receive a notification, you will see a change in the
notifications' icon. Depending on your notification settings, you might
also see an in-app notification with the specific change.

In the Notification Center you can:

  - Mark all notifications as **Read** or **Unread** by selecting the
    *glasses icon*.

  - **Group** your notifications by **Date** or **Team**.

  - Additionally, you can **turn off notifications** by selecting the
    *Mute this type of notification* option in the overflow menu.

    address associated with your account.
