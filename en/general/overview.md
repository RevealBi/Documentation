## Overview

Reveal is a self-service, cross-platform business intelligence tool that puts the power in your hands to do dashboard reporting - all without the
need for custom programming. With Reveal you can quickly create and edit dashboards, easily query and filter enterprise data sources, build meaningful visualization over data and effortlessly share your work with other Reveal users.

### General Navigation

When you first open Reveal, you will be greeted by the following screen:

![Reveal start screen view](images/reveal-initial-view.png)

Below you will find the menus on the initial Reveal screen and what you are able to do there.

1.  **My Stuff/Teams** - In this popover menu, you can access your personal space and any team you are a member of. You can also create new teams or join existing ones. 

> [!NOTE]
> Note that you have *Dashboards*, *Favorites* and *Recent* available in the left bar of both *My Stuff*, and each of your teams. Their contents (dashboards) will be different for you and for each of your teams. Still, you can have the same dashboard shared between two or more teams, for example, or copy a dashboard from a team to *My Stuff*, and vice versa.


1.  **Dashboards** - This is the central space for all dashboards. Start from here when you want to create, revise, or just find a dashboard you need. When accessing this space from the _My Stuff_ menu, you will find all dashboards created by you or shared with you. If you access this space in a team, dashboards created by other team members, or shared with your team are available for you to view and/or edit (depending on your [role permissions in the team](~/en/teams/overview.html#members-roles-permissions)).

  To open the content of a dashboard, you just need to click/tap on it. Select the overflow button in the top right-hand corner of a dashboard to **access advance dashboard actions** such as editing, sharing or deleting.

3.  **Favorites** - Your most important dashboards are always close at hand in the *Favorites* module.

4.  **Recent** - In the *Recent* module you will find the dashboards you have viewed or edited, sorted by the most recently used.

5.  **Dashboard samples** - In the *Samples* module you will find dashboards composed by the Reveal's team. Their rich variety of visualizations will inspire your creativity and help you create your own beautiful dashboards. 

6.  **+ Dashboard split button** - You can start creating a new dashboard by selecting the *+ Dashboard* split button.

  Clicking/tapping the arrow of the same button opens a dropdown menu providing two options:

  - *Upload* a Reveal dashboard (an .rdash file).

  - Create a new *Folder* in your personal space or in the team you are currently in.
        
7.  **Dashboards filter** - choose from the dropdown menu which dashboards to see in the dashboard module: all, only created by you
or shared with you.

8.  **Notifications center** - Select the the bell icon to view any team or dashboard updates.

9.  **Profile settings** - Select the icon with your initial (photo) to access Reveal's *general settings*, *learning tips*, *Help center* and *give feedback* or ask any questions related to the application.
