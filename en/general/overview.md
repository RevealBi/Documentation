Below you will find the menus on the initial Reveal screen and what you are able to do there.

1.  **My Stuff/Teams menu** - In this popover menu, you can access your personal space and any team you are a member of. You can also create new teams or join existing ones.

2.  **Dashboards module** - The dashboards     module provides you with a space where you can create, save and edit your dashboards. Teams
also have a dashboards space.

  To open the content of a dashboard, you just need to click/tap on it. Select the overflow button in the top right-hand corner of a
  dashboard to **access advance dashboard actions** such as editing, sharing or deleting.

6.  **+ Dashboard split button** - You can start creating a new dashboard by selecting the *+ Dashboard* split button.

  Clicking/tapping the arrow of the same button opens a dropdown menu providing two options:

        are currently in.
