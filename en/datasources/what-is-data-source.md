## What is a Data Source?

Data Sources are the places where your data comes from. Reveal provides
users the chance to connect to analytics tools, content managers, CRMs,
databases, spreadsheets, and public data sources. It also
does not require users to have direct access to these sources in their
computers or their network.

The screenshot below displays a number of different data sources one user has connected to in their application.
