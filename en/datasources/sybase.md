### Working with Views

With Reveal, you can retrieve Sybase data from entire tables, but you
can also select a particular
[view](http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.infocenter.dc32300.1570/html/sqlug/X29678.htm)
that returns a subset of data from a table or a set of tables instead.

![Select from Sybase views dialog](images/sybase-views.png)

The **Category Sales for 1997** view, for example, contains information on sales
projections taken from one of the tables in the database.

### Working with Stored Procedures

In Sybase, stored procedures allow users to run a set of query
statements in a relational database with specific parameters. The
following are just a set of sample stored procedures running in a test
server with data from the master database:

![Select from Sybase Stored Procedures dialog](images/sybase-stored-procedures.png)

In this case, for example, the stored procedure requires for users to set some time range values.
