  Here, you need to fill in the following information:

  - *(Optional)* **Domain**: the name of the domain, if applicable.

  - **Username**: the user account for the service.

  - **Password**: the password to access the service.

3. Click/Tap **Create** to finish. You will find your newly saved credentials at the bottom of the list in _Manage Reveal Credentials_.

### Using Your Stored Credentials

Unless you remove them, the accounts' credentials stored in Reveal will always appear in the *Choose Credentials* screen when configuring a data source requiring credentials.
