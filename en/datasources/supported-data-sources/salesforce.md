## Salesforce

Upon selecting the Salesforce data source, you will see the following login prompt:

![Salesforce login prompt](images/salesforce-login-prompt.png)

Enter your login credentials and click *Log In*.

If you have Identity Confirmation activations enabled, you will see a
prompt to enter the **verification code** sent to you. For more
information on Identity Confirmation Activations, visit the [Salesforce help](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=security_activation_about.htm&type=5).

You will then see an authorization prompt. Click *Allow*.

### Setting Up Your Data

After logging in, you can set up your Salesforce data in the following
dialog:

![Set up your data dialog](images/set-up-data-salesforce.png)

Here you can choose the Salesforce object you need from:

  - *Popular Objects* - this category allows quick selection between the
    seven most used objects among our users;

  - *All Objects* - this category displays the full list of objects
    contained in your Salesforce account.  You can use the provided search to find quickly the object you need.

### Using Reports

After selecting which report you want to use in the visualization editor, you need to set the values for the parameters in the dialog that follows:

![A dialog showing filters from Salesforce to be configured](images/filters-set-dialog.png)

The parameters you see in the list (_Show me_, _Probability_, etc.) are the filters for your report. Report filters are criteria set to control the data a user sees in their report. In Reveal, the filtered data will be used in your charts in the Visualization editor.

In the dialog above, filters are preconfigured with the default values from Salesforce. Use the dropdown next to each filter to change these values.

You can change the report filters' values later in the Visualization editor by choosing to _edit_ your data source (as shown below):
