## Oracle

There are two modes you can use to connect to Oracle depending on your
database's settings:

  - [**Using SID**](#using-sid): the unique name of your Oracle database
    instance.

  - [**Using Service**](#using-service): the alias used when connecting
    to the database instance.

### Using SID

To configure Oracle using SID, you will need to enter the following
information:

![Configure Oracle SID mode details](images/enter-oracle-details.png)

1.  **Data Source Name**: this field will be displayed in the Data
    Sources list.

1.  [**Server**](#how-to-find-server): the computer name or IP address
    assigned to the computer on which the server is running.

2.  **Port**: if applicable, the server port details. If no infomration
    is entered, Reveal will connect to the port in the hint text (1521)
    by default.

3.  **Connection Mode**: SID.

4.  **SID**: the unique name of your Oracle database instance. By
    default, the SID for Oracle is orcl. To find your SID, log into
    Server Manager and type select instance from v$thread. This will
    return your ORACLE\_SID.

5.  **Credentials**: after selecting *Credentials*, you will be able to
    enter the credentials for your Oracle server or select existing ones
    if applicable.

     - **Name**: the name for your data source account (default: _Oracle_). It will be
        displayed in the list of accounts in the previous dialog.

      - *(Optional)* **Domain**: the name of the domain, if applicable.

      - **Username**: the user account for the Oracle server.

      - **Password**: the password to access the Oracle server.

    Once ready, select **Create Account**. You can verify whether the
    account is reaching the data source or not by selecting **Test
    Connection**.

4.  **Connection Mode**: Service.

5.  **Service Name**: the alias used when connecting to the database
    instance. To find your Service, log into Server Manager and run
    select sys\_context('userenv', 'service\_name') from dual;. This
    will return your Service\_name.

### How to find your Server Information

You can find your server by following the steps below. Please note that
the commands should be executed on the server.

You can find your *IP address* by following the steps below. Please note
that the commands should be executed on the server.

| WINDOWS                              | LINUX                             | MAC                                                           |

| **IPv4 Address** is your IP address. | **Inet addr** is your IP address. | The **IP Address** field will have the necessary information. |

### Working with Views

With Reveal, you can retrieve Oracle data from entire tables, but you
can also select a particular
[view](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/objects.htm#i440066)
that returns a subset of data from a table or a set of tables instead.

![Oracle views dialog](images/Oracle-views.png)

The **invoices** view, for example, contains information on sales
projections taken from one of the tables in the database.
