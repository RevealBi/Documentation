### Working with Views

With Reveal, you can retrieve MySQL data from entire tables, but you can
also select a particular
[view](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/stored-programs-views.html)
that returns a subset of data from a table or a set of tables instead.

In the sample above, the **invoices** view contains a modified version
of the data in the **Products** table in the MySQL server.
