        <td><i>The .NET Server SDK was enhanced with several changes:</i><br>
        <i>- Registering Reveal services is more flexible</i> - You now can inject other services in your implementations of Reveal interfaces. You only register the type of your implementations of your Reveal providers interfaces.<br>
        <i>- RevealSDKContext removed</i> - RVUserContext is now first class citizen across reveal providers. You need to register a UserContextProvider, which will be instantiating that class and it would be passed to the methods of other Reveal services like IRVDashboardProvider.<br>
        <i>- .NET Core 3.1 or newer is now required</i> - Reveal dropped support for .NET Core running on top of .NET Framework v4.6.2 or higher and .NET core 2.2 as it is out of support.<br>
        <i>- Improved setup for default implementations</i> - Greatly improved setup for default implementations - Now it's pretty simple to setup Reveal if you have your dashboards in a "Dashboards" folder and your local data files (csv or excel) are located in your "Data" folder on the project root level. Example:<br>
        <i>services<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;.AddMvc()<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;.AddReveal();</i><br>
