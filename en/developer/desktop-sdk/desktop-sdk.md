### Summary

The following table lists the most common scenarios:

| **Scenario**   | **Details** |

| [**Configuring the RevealView Object**](configuring-revealview-desktop.md)| You can use **RevealView** with **RevealSettings** to show/hide UI elements, specify a dashboard, select global filter values. |
| [**Editing and Saving Dashboards**](editing-saving-dashboards-desktop.md)  | After providing the stream containing a dashboard file, you might want to handle a modified dashboard. |
| [**Replacing Data Sources**](replacing-data-sources-desktop.md)| You can override the configuration or data to be used for each visualization of the dashboard. |
| [**In-Memory Data Support**](in-memory-data-desktop.md) | Data that is part of your application and is already in memory can be used with Reveal SDK. |
