This will prompt the *New Visualization* dialog. In order to proceed, choose whether you want to create:

  - a simple [text box](~/en/data-visualizations/text-box.md).

If your data source is a spreadsheet in a content manager, you will be
able to select, for example, the specific sheet that you want to use in
your visualization.

### Changing your Visualization

Once your data source has been added, you will be taken to the Visualizations Editor. By default, the Grid visualization will be selected.

settings or add filters to it.

Once you have modified the visualization, you will be taken back to the
**Dashboard Editor**. You will see **Undo**, **Redo**,**Theme** and
**Save As** buttons on the top right-hand corner. You can also add any
other visualizations with the **+ sign** in the same location, or save
your dashboard by selecting the **tick icon**.

menu ⇒ *Theme* and switch between *Mountain Theme* and *Ocean Theme* as
