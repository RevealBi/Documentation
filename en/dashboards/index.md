## Dashboards

Dashboards are a quick and simple way to display minimal information at
first sight. It is a data visualization composed of a collection of
visualizations which are laid out to communicate the status, metrics,
or performance of a business. Each visualization is meant to have
different pieces of related information, enabling users to make sense of their data.

### The Dashboard Creation Process

  - **Discover the KPI**: decide what you or your analysts want to show
    in your dashboard, and what it needs to revolve around.

  - **Plan the Dashboard**: how will you represent your information
    graphically? Will you use a [grid](grid-view.md), a [map](map-view.md),
    [gauges](gauge-views.md), [category charts](category-charts.md), or even a
    [pyramid chart](https://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/b/infragistics/posts/creating-a-population-pyramid-chart-using-stacked-bar-charts-with-Reveal)?
    Will you use any [filters](filters.md)? If you want to see how to
