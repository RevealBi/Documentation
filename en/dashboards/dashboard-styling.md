## Styling Dashboards

Reveal makes dashboards styling as easy as choosing a color palette.

In order to change dashboard style settings, switch to *Dashboard Edit*
mode and select *Theme* from the overflow menu. Here you can choose
between *Default* and *Light* theme.

In addition, you can also change the Start Color for chart-based
visualizations. The options available will vary according to the
dashboard theme you select.
