## Exporting Dashboards as PowerPoint Presentations

Reveal allows you to export your dashboard as a PowerPoint presentation.
Every visualization that is part of this dashboard will be displayed on
a separate slide of the presentation.

All the elements of the presentation are editable so that you can tailor
it to your needs.

To export a dashboard as a PowerPoint presentation, go to dashboard
*View mode* and select: the overflow menu ⇒ *Export* ⇒ *PowerPoint*. The
*Export Dashboard* dialog will open, allowing you to set up your
presentation and annotate specific slides.
