## Exporting Dashboards as PDF Documents

Reveal allows you to export your dashboard as a PDF document. Every
visualization that is part of this dashboard will be displayed on a
separate page of the document.

To export a dashboard as a PDF document, go to dashboard *View mode* and
select: the overflow menu ⇒ *Export* ⇒ *PDF*. The *Export Dashboard*
dialog will open, allowing you to edit your document and annotate
specific pages, so that you can tailor it to your needs.

### Export Settings
