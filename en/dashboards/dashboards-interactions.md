# Interacting with Dashboards

You can open existing dashboards by selecting the dashboard thumbnail image in the initial view.

<img src="images/dashboard-opened-edit-mode.png" alt="dashboard opened in edit mode" class="responsive-img"/>

You can **interact** with dashboard visualizations in various ways. For instance, if the visualization is a grid chart, you can scroll horizontally and
vertically. The chart view supports zooming and panning. Also drill down & drill up actions become possible if the underlying data model supports it.

## Maximized view

Once the dashboard is opened, you can **maximize** any of the dashboard visualizations by hovering over them and click/tap on the arrow in the right top corner.

<img src="images/visualization-maximizing-arrow.png" alt="maximizing arrow in the top right corner" class="responsive-img"/>

The maximized view allows a larger display of the information.

<img src="images/maximized-visualization.png" alt="maximized visualization view" class="responsive-img"/>

In this mode, you can also switch the maximized view to other visualizations by selecting the **small chart icon** in the top right corner. Different visualizations are displayed based on the data that was used in the editor. Only chart types that work well with your data will be offered.

If you want to save the changed visualization, you need to have edit permissions, be in [dashboard Edit Mode](#view-edit-mode) and explicitly save the changes by selecting the check icon in the top right corner. You have edit permission for dashboards that are created by you or shared with you with [Owner or Modify permissions](~/en/dashboards/sharing-dashboards/share-a-dashboard.html#access-permissions).

You can also look at the data behind your chart if you select the **hash sign** icon.

<img src="images/flip-grid.png" alt="flip to grid" class="responsive-img"/>

When viewing the data behind your visualization, you can apply sorting (ascending or descending). For more information on applying sorting to grids, check the [Grid Chart](~/en/data-visualizations/visualization-types/grid-chart.md) topic.

If, at any point, you want to revert back to the original visualization, you can select the **"Show Original"** link.

## Regular Tooltips

By clicking on particular visualizations (press and hold in touch environments), you can see tooltips popups. Tooltips help you see values
at a particular point of your chart like:

<img src="images/tooltips-popups.png" alt="tooltips popups on visualizations" class="responsive-img"/>

To close regular tooltips just click or tap away.

## Hover Tooltips & Crosshairs

You will find two options in the **Interactions** menu: *Hover tooltips* and *Crosshairs*. Only *Hover tooltips* is enabled by default. Both are only available in Dashboard View mode. They can't be used in Dashboard Edit mode.

<img src="images/dashboard-interactions-menu.png" alt="Accessing Reveal's Dashboard Interactions menu" class="responsive-img"/>

  - With *Hover Tooltips* enabled, you can see **tooltips** popups when you hover over data (press and hold in touch environments).

    <img src="images/tooltips-hover.png" alt="Reveal displays tooltips when hovering over data" class="responsive-img"/>

    By clicking the data (releasing drag tooltips in touch
    environments), you can access the **Tools** section with tooltip
    interactions like drill down, drill up, or linked dashboards if
    applicable.

  - With *Crosshairs* enabled, Reveal shows crosshairs elements along
    with the tooltips. Giving more context to the tooltip.

    <img src="images/crosshairs-enabled.png" alt="Reveal displays crosshairs along with tooltips" class="responsive-img"/>

Crosshairs are currently supported for the following data
visualizations: Scatter, Bubble, Area, Candlestick, Line, Ohlc, Spline,
SplineArea, StepArea, StepLine.

Candlestick and OHLC visualizations only display horizontal crosshairs.
Including a vertical crosshair would make it difficult to see the lines
on the data point.

## Tooltips Totals

When displaying tooltips, you can configure them to display total values by Category.

<img src="images/tooltips-totals.png" alt="Reveal Portrait Orientation" class="responsive-img"/>

To enable this feature, go to *Settings* \> *Show Totals on Tooltip*,
like shown below:

<img src="images/tooltips-configuration.png" alt="Reveal Portrait Orientation" class="responsive-img"/>

When enabling totals, make sure you added a Category to show multiple
values in your visualization.

## View & Edit Modes

When first opening a dashboard, you will be browsing it in **View
mode**. This mode allows you to navigate and filter the information
displayed in it, but you won't be able to change the dashboard
definition.

In order to apply changes to a dashboard, you must switch to **Dashboard
Edit mode**. You can do this by selecting *Edit* from the overflow menu
in the top right corner of the dashboard. This enables editing options
such as applying *Auto Layout*, and a dashboard *Theme*.

Shown below is a dashboard in *Dashboard Edit* mode:

<img src="images/dashboard-opened-edit-mode.png" alt="dashboard opened in edit mode" class="responsive-img"/>

To **exit Edit mode**, you only need to select the *check icon* in the
top right-hand corner. This switches back to *View Mode*.

## Dashboard Filters

It is possible to filter information at a dashboard or a visualization
level.

  - [**Dashboard filters**](~/en/filters/dashboard-filters.md) are available, when you open Dashboard Edit mode (select *Edit* from the overflow menu of your dashboard to access this mode). In the left top corner of the screen, you will see the current dashboard filters and an option to add new ones.

  - [**Visualization filters**](~/en/filters/visualization-filters.md) (a.k.a. Quick Filters) are displayed in maximized mode. You can find them in the top section of the visualization under the visualization's name.

For more information on dashboard or visualization Filters, check out
[this section](~/en/filters/overview.md).

## Auto Layout for Visualizations

Reveal's Auto Layout dynamically sizes all visualizations in your
dashboard based on the size constraints of your device and on the amount
of visualizations it has.

<img src="images/auto-layout-dashboard.png" alt="auto layout view and resizing of dashboards" class="responsive-img"/>

To start resizing visualizations while Auto Layout is enabled, just drag their corners downwards or to the side. This will automatically turn *Auto Layout* off.
