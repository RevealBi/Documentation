Data used for the visualization
Sort of requirement for the app is to have at least one field that will find a way to map to share/shape keys???

Each map has a list of records in it. All these records represent the shape on the map. These shapes all have a key. And they are all pretty standardized. For example, when using the World map, the main key will be the country.
