## Text View

The Text View displays information that follows a key-value pattern,
such as the employee record displayed below. It does so by displaying
only the first row of data paired with the column's label. In order to
display a specific row it's possible to apply filters to make sure
that's the only row displayed, so it's the one picked up by the Text
View. It is suitable when you want to allow the viewer to easily digest
the attributes of a single entity. Examples include product
specifications, or a person's contact information, etc.
