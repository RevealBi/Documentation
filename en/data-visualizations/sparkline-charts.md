## Sparkline Charts

Sparkline charts are small charts plotted within a grid view, without
any axes, labels, or other chart elements, that are meant to represent
trends and their progression in a given date range.

The first column remains fixed in the Visualizations Editor, allowing
you to scroll through the different columns in your information.
