## Creating and Joining Teams

*Teams* in Reveal enables easy collaboration within and out of your
organization. Now you can access and join freely all your organization's
teams and also make your own team available for others in the
organization to join and work with you.

Start using Teams by [creating a team from scratch](#create-team-scratch) or [joining an existing team](#join-team).

  ![join or create a team button in the popover menu](images/button-join-create-team.png)


  >[!NOTE]
  > When signing in for the first time, you might already have a team. This is your [Organization team](index.html#organization-team) including other members of your organization, who have logged in Reveal with their Office365 account at least once.



2.  Click/Tap the *+ Create Team* blue button. The following screen
    opens:

    ![team properties dialog](images/create-team-properties.png)

    Here you will need to:

      - assign a *name* to your team;

      - choose if your team will belong to the main *Organization*.

          - [Organization team](index.html#organization-team) (this
            option will appear with the name of your organization, e.g.
            *Infragistics, Inc*) - if you associate your team with the
            main Organization team, your team will appear in the list of
            teams that every member of the main Organization can
            [join](#join-team) (unless you make your team private).

          - *Personal organization* - your new team does not belong to
            the main Organization and cannot be joined by other users
            without invitation.

            >[!NOTE]
            >Carefully choose the *Organization* property for your team as you cannot change it later.
      - decide on team's [*privacy*](index.html#team-privacy-levels) - this option will not be availabe if you choose _Personal Organization_ for your team. 
  
      - configure _branding_ settings - choose a main color and logo to be used when the teams' dashboards are exported as [PDF documents](~/en/dashboards/exporting/export-as-pdf-document.md) and [PPT presentations](~/en/dashboards/exporting/export-as-powerpoint-presentation). 
       
        >[!NOTE] **Requirements for logo images**. The image you upload for a logo must be no bigger than **5 MB** and one of the following formats: jpg, jpeg, png, gif.

3.  Click/Tap *Create* to continue. Start inviting members to your team by selecting the *+ Members* blue button and adding their emails to the list. They will receive an
invitation by email.

    ![invite members dialog](images/team-invite-members.png)

    *Member* is the default role for every user you invite, unless you assign them a different role.

    >[!NOTE]
    >When adding members, whose emails are not auto-completed by Reveal, type the whole email and press Enter to add it to the list of users you want to invite.

4.  After clicking/tapping *Send Invites* button your new team is

    [permissions](index.html#members-roles-permissions)
    to the team you have chosen. The team will appear in your teams' list.

### Organizing your Teams' List

There is no limit to the teams you can create or join. To easily navigate through a large list of teams and find the one you need, you can filter your teams by:

* the *Organization* they belong to,
* *favorites*,
* custom *groups* you have created.

#### Filtering by Organization

Filtering by organization appears as an option only if you have at least one team, which is part of your *Organization team* and one team, which is a *Personal team*. 

1.  Click/Tap the popover menu in the top left corner (next to the _Reveal_ icon).

2. Click/Tap _All Organizations_ dropdown on top of your teams' list.

>[!NOTE]
>**All Organizations menu not available**. The _All Organizations_ dropdown menu will not appear unless you have both teams belonging to the main Organization, and _Personal Organization_ teams.


#### Adding to Favorites

1. Click/Tap the overflow menu of any team in your teams' list.
2. Select _Favorite_.
