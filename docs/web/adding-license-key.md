# Adding a License Key

When you install the Reveal SDK, a license key must be provided or the SDK will not function. There are two types of license keys
- Trial - obtained when requesting a trial from the [Reveal SDK Website](https://www.revealbi.io/download-sdk)
- Licensed - obtained when the Reveal SDK is purchased and is available in the [customer portal](https://account.infragistics.com/subscriptions)

## Key File
By default, the Reveal SDK will look for a valid license in a file called `license.key` within a folder named `.revealbi-sdk` in the user's "Home" directory.

The "Home" directory differs depending on the OS you are using.
- Windows: `C:/Users/your-user-name/`
- Mac: `/Users/your-user-name/`
- Linux: `/home/your-user-name/`

When you receive your license key, create a text file named `license.key` within a directory named `.revealbi-sdk` located in your "Home" directory. Populate this file with your license key as its content.

:::note [Contents of Lisense Key File]

Ensure the file contains only the raw license string, without extra code, comments, quotes or formatting. Otherwise, a runtime error on may give a system exception that the file is not a valid Base-64 string.
:::

For example; if using Windows the license file location should be located at `C:/Users/your-user-name/.revealbi-sdk/license.key`.

## Set In Code

The license key can also be provide in the application code.
