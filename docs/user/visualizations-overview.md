## Choosing the Right Chart Type

In choosing the best chart type you need to look at your data and answer the questions that will help you find out what story you are trying to tell with your visualization.

Are you trying to compare data, show data distribution or present it as a part to a whole breakdown? Are you doing a trend analysis of your financial, marketing or sales data, need a date/time axis? Are you looking at relationships between data? Or you just want to show KPIs and gauges, which are really easy to read and tell a quick story? Is it important to plot your data on a map?
